    <h2>Shri  Naganathswamy - Kizhperumpallam</h2>
    <h3> Navagraha sthalam - Kethu </h3>

<p> Sri Naganathaswamy Temple , which is one of the Navagraha sthalam is located in the town of Keezhperumpallam near Sirkazhi and is around 28 kms from Mayavaram. This temple is dedicated to Kethu bhagawan, one of the Navagrahas. Here Naganathar is the main deity and ambal is Soundarya devi </p> 


 
<p>When devas and asuras got the 'Amudham' (elixir) after churning the 'paar kadal', the amudham was being distributed to devas. One of the asuras disguising himself as a deva stealthily joined the line and consumed the amudham. On seeing this, Maha Vishnu struck him with his chakra and the the asura's body was cut into two. The cut head joined with the body of a snake, becoming Raaghu  and the cut body joined with the head of the snake becoming Kethu. They repented for their mistakes and prayed that they also may be granted the status of grahas so people can worship them. Their wish was granted.</p> <p> According to another legend, asuras who were denied of their share of amudham, got angry and vented their fury over the serpent Vasuki and threw Vasuki towards the earth.The injured Vasuki recovered soon and started repenting that Lord Shiva had to consume the poison it had spewed while churning the ocean. Vasuki asked Shiva for forgiveness her at this Keezhpurumballam.Shiva as Naganatha swamy with his consort as Soundarya devi blessed Vasuki and asked him to bless the devotees who visit this temple.</p>
 
<p> The temple has no big rajagopurams and is small when compared to other temples around this belt.This was built by Chola kings during 9-10th century AD. The temple face east and you can see the holy tank naga theertham in front of the temple. As you enter and walk through clockwise, you can see in the west praharam, the sannithis of Ganesha, Lord Subramanya with Valli and Deivanai, Durga, Lakshmi Narayana, Maheswari and Gajalakshmi. </p> <p> Sri Naganathaswamy is seen here as a Lingam. After we come out this sanctum, we can see the ambal Soundarya Nayaki.</p>
