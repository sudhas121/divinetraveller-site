     <p> Thiruttani Subramanya Swamy Temple of Lord Subramanya is located on top of a hillock in Thiruttani is 90 kms from Chennai. This is also known as Thiruthanikai. It is  one of the six <a href="arupadaiveedu.html" > "Aaru padai veedu" </a> (six abodes of Lord Muruga).</p>
     <p> As per the legends Subramanya along with his lieutenant Veerabaghu, fought with the demon king Soorbathman in a long battle and killed him. Subramanya was fierce and seething with anger even after killing him. He came to Thiruttani to calm himself and meditated, hence this place is also known as Shantipuri (Abode of Peace).  </p>
     <p>As per another legend Lord  Subramanya married Valli, a gypsy girl from the Vallimalai hills nearby, and had settled here. </p>
     <p>There are other legends too. Subramanya married Indra's daughter Deivayanai and was offered his elephant Iravatam as a part of the wedding gift. Indra started losing his wealth after the elephan Iravatham, Subramanya wanted to return the elephant to Indra.Indra refused to take back the gift and instead requested that the elephant should face in his direction. The elephant in the temple can be seen facing east.<br> 
         According to another legend, Indra presented a sandal stone as a part of the wedding gifts. This sandal paste is applied to Sri Subramanya’s idol even today and a prasadam of this is considered to be of medicinal value. <br>
         There is an indentation in Lord Subramanya's chest, and as per legend this was because demon Tarakasuran threw a Chakrayudham(discus) on his chest. This Chakrayudam was later given to Maha Vishnu.
