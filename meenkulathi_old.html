Centuries ago in the now Tamil Nadu, three families belonging to the Veerasaiva Mannadiar clan worshipped the goddess Meenakshi as their deity. An acute drought in Chidambaram in Tamil nadu drove them to seek better places. One of them took a stone from there along with their other possessions. Worshipping their stone as their friend, philosopher and guide, they trekked to several places before reaching Pallasena a place in the then called Malabar. Delighted by the forests surrounding the villages they settled there and prospered in the diamond trade. Whenever they went on business, they offered their customary prayers to the family deity. An aged member of their clan was very sad that he will not be able to travel distances to worship his family deity Meenakshi thereafter because of his age and failing health. After returning home the heavy hearted man went for his customary bath before entering his home. He left all his valuables and a palm leaf umbrella in the care of two youths. When he came back, he was surprised that he could not lift the things he had left with the youths. An astrologer said that Meenakshi had manifested herself under the umbrella and that was why it could not be moved. Huge crowds came there to witness the miracle. The place came to be known as Kudamannu. <br />The present Meenakshi temple and the adjacent temple tank were constructed over the next four centuries.

<p>The structure is built in the Kerala style.. There are two entrances, one in the north and the other in the west. The temple tank is next to the western entrance.
Inside the temple is a massive dhwajasthambha[made of teakwood and covered with copper. The sanctum sanctorium or the garbhagriha contains a large idol of Meenakshi Amman. Devotees are not allowed to go around the garbhagriha as is the general custom in many temples.. Around the main idol, saptha maathas (seven female deities - Brahmi, Maheswari, Kaumari, Vaishnavai, Indrani, Chamundi and Varahi) are installed. There are separate shrines for Ganapathi, Ayyappa, Veerabhadra, Shiva, Durga and Brahma rakshasas.
There is a special offering called Nirappara Panam costing around Rs 500 for a family of four. You will be allowed to bypass the long queue and stand before the main deity. You will be asked to fill a big casket with thousands of coins in another casket with both of your palms. This is supposed to bring prosperity to the family and your genuine wishes shall be fulfilled.
The temple tank to the west is beautiful and serene.  Devotees can take a holy bath here.

<strong>How to reach?</strong> The village Pallasena is around 18 kms from Palghat town and 70 kms from the major city Coimbatore. There are KSRTC buses and other private buses to this place from Palghat. You can also hire a taxi that might cost you Rs 500 or so. The drive to Pallasena among the lush green beautiful  paddy fields is an experience to cherish.
<strong>Where to stay?</strong> I do not know of any good place in Pallasena itself. There are a few lodges here but I advise you to stay at Palghat town itself.

<strong>Temple timings. </strong>In normal days the temple is open from 5 AM to 12 noon and 4pm to 9pm. During festival days and Sabarimala season, the timing could be different.<br/>
