 <p>  A five storied Gopuram about 50 feet leads to the temple.  You have to go via big devotees' waiting halls in batches that will lead you right into the praharam.Even in normal days you will be jostled by the crowds and you will rarely have any time to see around and appreciate. Frankly, though  I have visited several times, I hardly recollect the architecture and apperance of the temple structure. Your concentartion will be on seeing the Lord among the frantic chants of 'Govinda','Ezhumalai vasa' etc.

 </p>


      
 <p>The <b>moolavar</b> Srinivasa or Sree Venkatachalapathy or Balaji or Thiruvekandamudian or Govinda as he is fondly knaown by many names, is seen in 'Nindra kolam' (standing posture). with chatur pujam (four hands) one in varada posture, one placed over his thigh and other two holding the Conch (Sangu) and Sudarshana Chakra respectively. The sanctum (garbagriham) is lit with oil lamps only and the lord with his costliest costumes of gold and precious stones looks beautiful,displaying Goddess Lakshmi on the right chest and Goddess Padmavathi on the left.You are lucky if you can have darshan of the Lord Srinivasa for 60 seconds. You will be forcibly pushed out by the guards in an effort to control the crowd.</p>
   <p>There are other deities in the praharam such as deities of Rama,Sita, Lakshmana, Rukmini and Sri Krishna,Chakratalwar,Garuda, Yoga Narasimha, Varadaraja, Kubera, Anjaneya in their respective small shrines or the niches of the wall.The vimanam ( gopuram over the sanctum) is a beautiful gold plated structure with Vimana Venkateswara. It is customary to have a darshan of this when you come out.</p>
     <p><b>Utsavar </b> Kalyana Venkateswarar,Malayappa swamy</p>
     <p><b>Prathyaksham </b> King Thondaiman, Lord Subramanya</p>

     <p>  <strong>Thayar</strong>&nbsp; of this sthalam is Sree Padmavathi Thayaar, but her sannidhi is at Tiruchanoor or Alarmelmangapuram.</p>
     <p><strong> Other Sannidhis: </strong> 
         There is a seperate sannidhi for Sri Adi Varahar situated in Sri Bhu Varaha Swamy temple which is located to the north of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple, on the banks of Swami Pushkarini. The moolavar Sri Bhu Varaha Swamy, an avatar of Lord Sri Maha Vishnu in the form of a wild boar,is said to have been on the hills when Lord Sri Venkateswara as Srinivasa descended onto the earth.It is customary to visit here first and then proceed to see Srinivasa perumal. Neivethyams (offerings) are first made to this deity and only then taken to Sri Venkatachalapathy.
     <p><strong> Mangalasasanams</strong> The temple is revered by 202 verses by Andal and other Alwars. </p>
     
     <p><b>Restrictions and dress code</b> Gents must enter the temple in a decent attire. Not shorts or lungis.Ladies should come in saree or half saree or Chudidars with dupatta(upper cloth)</p><p>The security checks are as stringent as you can see in airports, with metal detectors,body frisking,bag scanning.</p><p>The temple is very strict in allowing electronic items such as mobile phones,camera,ipads,walkman,earphones and even your smart watches and Fitbits. All the prohibited items are to deposited in the cloak room near the temple entrance.
