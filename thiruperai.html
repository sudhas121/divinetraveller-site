<p> Makara Nedunkuzhaikathar Temple  is one of the 108 Divya Desams and a Nava Tirupathi located in Alwar Thirunagari,on the state highway no.40, Tamil Nadu, South India in the banks of Thamiraparani river. This is also called as Navagraha Tirupathis because each of the Navagrahas is said to have worshipped at the temples here. In that aspect this is dedicated to Sukran.Thiruperai is also called as Thenthiruperai. 

</p>
     <p>As per legends, Mahavishnu's consort Bhoomadevi was cursed by Sage Dhurvasar.Bhumadevi lost all her charm and took the form of Sri Devi. She pleaded with the Sage and as instructed by him she did a severe penance towards Maha Vishnu, at the southern bank of river Thamirabarani.One day she saw two ear rings shaped like fishes floating near her. As she was always thinking of Narayana, she wished that the ear rings should be adorned by him. Maha Vishnu appeared before her and gladly accepted the Fish like ear rings. Bhooma devi was also releived of her curse. As Maha vishnu wore the the Fish shaped ear rings , he became to be known as 'Mahar Nedun kuzhai Kathan' ( one who is wearing Fish shaped ear rings in his ears).Since Bhoodevi took the form and colour of Sridevi as cursd by the Sage Dhurvasar, this place came to be called Sri Perai or Thiru Perai.<br>
         Rain God Varuna lost his weapon Pasam as he disrepected Guru Bhagawan and undertook a penance here at the Thamiraparni river. Lord Vishnu is said to have appeared before him on the full moon day in the month of Panguni(Phalguna) and helped him recover his lost weapon as well as his powers. It is believed that Varuna visits this temple every year, on the full moon day in the month of Panguni (March-April) to worship Maha Vishnu.


</p>
  
            <p>The temple does not have the main Gopuram like other temples. There is a big maha mandapam in front of the sanctum.  We can see exiquisite stone sculptures and carvings of Yalis,soldiers,elephants in the pillars of this temple.<br>
                The sannidhi of Thaayar Thiruperai Nachiyar is located to the right of the Perumal sannidhi and to the left is the Kuzhaikadhavalli Thayaar sannidhi. </p>

            <p>The <strong> Moolavar</strong> here is Sri Makara Nedunkuzhaikathar also called Niharil Muhil Vannan and is found in a veetrindha kolam(sitting posture) facing the east with his consorts Sridevi and Bhoodevi.Prathyaksham for Sukran,Brahma.</p> 
           <p><strong> Thayaar</strong>  Thiruperai Nachiyar and Kuzhaikadhavalli Thayaar .</p>
 <p><strong> Mangalaasasanam</strong>&nbsp;The temple is revered by the verses of Nammalwar.</p>
     
     <p><b>Festivals </b>During the Garuda Sevai utsavam(festival) in the month of Vaikasi(May-Jun) there are nine Garudasevai, a big event in which the utsava murthis are brought on Garuda vahana. </p>
     
            <p>
               <strong> Temple location </strong> The temple is situated in Tirunelveli to Tiruchendur route near Alwar Thirunagari.
             </p>
             <p><strong> Temple Timings</strong> The temple is open from 7:30 AM till 12:00 noon and from 5:00 pm till 8:00 pm</p>
<p>
   <strong> How to reach?</strong>  <br/>
     It is well connected by state highways roads, and this temple is off SH-40, the Tiruchendur-Tenkasi route. Take your car or hire a cab to visit all the nine Tirupathis, going by the local bus is time consuming. If you are only three or less travellers, local auto rickshaws are the cheapest and best mode of transport.Negotiate and fix a rate for the day trip. <br>
     Those in Chennai can avail the services of Tamilnadu Tourism Development Corporation which is arranging the trip twice a month on the first and third Friday of the month. They can return by Wednesday morning. 
     
    <br/>
   <strong>Where to Stay?</strong> There are no big hotels here. Tiruchendur or Tirunelveli which are under 30 kms from here would be an ideal place for stay<br/>
    <strong>Where to eat </strong> There are several restauarants here.Use your judgement to find a hygienic place to eat in the available eateries.<br>
    <strong>Other interesting places around Thiruperai</strong>.Sri Kailasanathar Temple one of the nava Kailasams is very near the perumal temple.
