<p> The Siddhatek temple is another one of the Ashtavinayaka, the eight revered shrines of Ganesha in Maharashtra. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is located on the northern bank of the river Bhima in Siddhatek in the Karjat taluka of Ahmednagar district.
<p> The temple stands on a hillock, surrounded by  Babul trees and is located near the Siddhatek village. Devotees often perform <em>pradakshina</em> (Circumambulation) of the hillock (also known as Giri valam) seven times,braving the rough path with thorny shrubs.</p>
 <p>The deity is seen  seated, with His trunk turned to the right (Valampuri). This is the only Ashtavinayaka shrine where the deity has his trunk to the right.</p>
 <p>Like all Ashtavinayaka shrines, the main Ganesha idol is believed to be <u>swayambu</u> (self formed), naturally occurring in the form of an elephant-faced stone.</p>
 <p>The Mudgala Purana narrates that at the beginning of Creation, Brahma emerged from the lotus of Sri Narayana's navel as he was sleeping in his anathasayana. While Brahma starts creating the universe, two demons Madhu and Kaitabha rose from the dirt in Maha Vishnu's ear. The demons started teasing and disturbing Brahma's process of creation, thereby compelling Vishnu to arise from his slumber. Vishnu fights with the demons, but could not defeat them. He asks Lord Shiva the reason for this and Shiva informs MahaVishnu that he could not succeed as he had forgotten to invoke Ganesha before the fight. Therefore Vishnu performs penance at Siddhatek.  Pleased, Ganesha bestows his blessings and various siddhis on Maha Vishnu who returned to the battle and slayed the demons. The place where Vishnu acquired siddhi became to be known as Siddhatek.</p>
<p>The original temple is believed to have been built by Maha Vishnu, however it got dissipated over the yugas. Later, a cow herd is believed to have had a vision in his dream of the ancient temple and found the idol of Siddhi Vinayaka. The cowherd worshipped the deity and soon others in the village came to know of the shrine.
<p>The present temple was built in the late 1700s by Ahilyabai Holkar who built and renovated many other Hindu temples.</p> 
<p>The Ganapatya, a sect that worships Ganesha as the Supreme Brahma (Parabrahma) , Saint Morya Gosavi (dated between 13th to 17th century) who popularised Ganapatya, and Narayan Maharaj are described as having worshipped here at the temple.</p>

 <p > The garbhagriha (sanctum) is 15 ft high and 10 ft wide. Moolavar (main deity) is seen flanked by brass sculptures of Jaya and Vijaya,the gatekeepers of Maha Vishnu's abode . Like all other Ashtavinayaka shrines, the Ganesha is believed to be svayambhu (self-existent), naturally occurring in the form of an elephantfaced stone. The central icon of Siddhi-Vinayaka is seated cross-legged with his consort Siddhi seated nearby, though often she is hidden with flower garlands and the sindoor paste that covers the image.

Only recently the bridge has been constructed and now all sort of four wheelers including buses can approach the temple.</p> <p> There is a beleif among the yatris that you throw a coin in the river and your sins gets washed away. So do not be surprised if you see people hurling coins in the river</p>

   <strong> How to reach?</strong>  <br/>
 <p>  1) State transport bus service available between Shivaji Nagar(Pune) to Siddhatek.<br />
2) If you are driving by your car ,it is Pune-Hadapsar-Loni-Vawat-Chaufula-Patas-Daund-Siddhatek. Daund-Siddhatek distance is 18 km. <br />

<p>As per my experience,the best alternative is to take a group travel to Ashta Vinayaka yatra from reputed travels in Pune or Mumbai. </p>
