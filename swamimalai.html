     <p> Swamimalai Murugan Temple is located in Swamimalai, 7 km from Kumbakonam on the banks of a tributary of river Cauvery.  It is  one of the six "aru padai veedu" (six abodes of Lord Muruga)  .</p>
<p>As per mythology , sage Bhrugu before commencing a very difficult penance, got a boon that anyone disturbing his meditation will forget all his knowledge. Such was the power of the penance that the heat from the penance reached the Heaven, and the frightened devas surrendered to Lord Siva to save them. The Lord came down to Bhrugu and he woke up from the penance and, as per Bhrughu's boon whoever disturbs him will lose his knowledge, Lord Siva lost his knowledge. Bhrughu got very upset saying he became the cause for Siva to lose his knowledge. Lord Siva said pacified him saying that he will regain all these soon by his son.</p>

    <p> Meanwhile once when Brahma, was proceeding to Kailash, child Lord Muruga asked him for the meaning of the Pranava mantra 'AuM'. When Brahma blinked and could not answer correctly, Muruga imprisoned him. With Brahma in a prison, all creations came to a standstill and the devas prayed to Lord Siva to get Brahma released. Siva came to Muruga and ordered him to release Brahma from imprisonment. Muruga refused and said that the imprisonment was a punishment for the ignorance of Brahma for not knowing the meaning of Pranava mantra being a creator. Lord Siva asked him whether Muruga knew the meaning of the Pranava mantra AuM. Lord Muruga said that he knew the meaning and can offer it to the Siva only if he can accept him as a guru and listen to the explanation as a devoted disciple. Lord Siva acceded to the request of Lord Muruga and heard the exposition of AuM as a disciple, the place came to be known as Swamimalai and the presiding deity as Swaminathan.</p>

<p>The temple is built on man made hillock of about sixty feet height with sixty  stone steps leading to the temple. Each step represents the Hindu cycle of sixty years. </p>
<p>Hymns in praise of Muruga have been sung by saint Nakkeerar in Tirumurukatrupadai and by Saint Arunagirnathar in Tiruppukazh.</p>

<p>The temple is said to be in existence  from 2nd century BC. The temple was believed to have been built by Parantaka Chola I. The temple has three gopurams and three praharams. Out of the three praharams, one is at the foothill, the second at midway to the top of the hillock and the third around the sanctum of the Swaminathaswamy shrine.</p><p>In the first praharam we can see the shrines Dakshinamurthy, Durga, Chandikeswarar and the utsavar of Swaminathaswamy. The second praharam is large and has a marriage hall and the chariot of the temple. Many marriages takes place in this hall and people come all over the state to get married here.</p>
<p>As you climb the sixty steps, you enter the main sanctum of the temple. You can see the Iravatham ( Indra's white elephant) in front of Lord Muruga. It is an unique feature as all other Murugan temples has Peacock in front of the Lord.The idol of Swaminathaswamy stands majestically at  6 ft with golden a lance studded with diamonds in his right hand ( usually on special occassions) and other hand on his hips.</p><p> Like other Murugan temples, the Lord here is anoited with sandal paste and pancahmirtham ( milk,honey,banana,ghee and jaggery- five compounds) as abishekams at specific pooja times.</p>
