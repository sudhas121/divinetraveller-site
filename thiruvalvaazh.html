    <p>Thiruvalvaazh Sree Vallabha temple is one of the 108 divya desam temples situated in Tiruvalla,Kerala.   </p><p>There are many legends associated with this temple. Sreevallabha temple has been glorified by Alwars and many other ancient works. It is considered to be the vallabha kshethram mentioned in Garuda Puranam and Matsya Puranam.</p>
     <p>There was a demon who was also the  leader of Lord Shiva's Siva Ganangal, was fierce and  gave Narabali (human scarifice) for Siva.Lord Siva asked him not to do this and asked him to worship  Lord Narayanan. He also said by worshipping him, he can get salvation and can attain Paramapadham. The chief of the Ganas, who was a staunch saivate, changed to Vaishnavam and started chant the Ashtakshara Mantram, "Om Namo Narayanaya". At the same time he stopped worshipping Lord Siva and tied two small bells on his ears to avoid hearing Shiva's name or his mantram "Om Nama Shivaya". He then became to be known as 'Kanda Karnan' (Bells on his ears)</p>

        <p>Though not wanting to hear the mantram of Lord Shiva he was really thinking about him and at the same time he was devoted towards Sri Narayana by chanting the Ashtakshara mantram, "Om Namo Narayana".  He eventually attained the paramapadham. To show the unity of Saivam and Vaishnavam, in this sthalam Thiru Neeru (Vibhoodi) is given as the Prasadham to the devotees,which is not a normal practice in Vaishnava temples. </p>
            <p>As per another legend, there lived an illiterate woman called Antharjanam (later to be known as Sankaramangala thenmai). She is a great devotee of Sri Narayanan. She used to observe fasting during ekadasis and after the fasting she used to feed brahmacharis(bachelors). Once she was waiting to offer food to a brahmachari, a demon named Tholakasuran stood in front of her home seeing that no brahmacharis could enter and get food from her. Sankaramangala then prayed to Sriman Narayana. Perumal took the form of a brahmachari and fought with the asuran and killed him. Perumal in the disguise of brahmacahri and ate the food Sankaramangala offered him.Sankaramangala realised that he is  none other than Sri Narayana and she asked him to remove the vastram over his chest. In the bare chest she could see the figure of Periya pirati and she realised that he is Sri Narayana himself. As he came as a brahmachari he is also called as "Sri Vallabhan". </p>

 <p> The sanctum is round shaped and you can see big eight feet'sangu' and 'chakram' in front of the moolavar.Sreevallabha murthy is a massive 7 feet tall and is situated at a height of 10 feet. We can see the Sudarsana murthy on the rear side of the sanctum facing west.

No other temple is known to have both lord Vishnu and lord Sudarsana under same roof. There are numerous 'Paavai vilaku' statues on the inside wall of the praharam. </p>
