    <p> Kateel Sri Durga Parameshwari temple is a temple town located at a distance of 29 km from Mangalore city, and it is situated on an islet, right in the middle of the sacred river Nandini.  </p>

    

<p>According to legend ,when Goddess Durga killed Shumbha and Nishumbha, their deputy Arunasura escaped from the battlefield. Later he became the king of the Rakshasas and started toubling the sages and their Yajnas. Devas stopped rains, which resulted in total drought and scarcity food on the earth. Maharshi Jabali decided to perform a Yajna to appease the Devas.

He approached Devendra and requested him to send Kamadhenu for the ritual. Devendra asked the sage to take Kamadhenu's daughter Nandini instead, for his proposed Yajna. Nandini refused to accompany him and he cursed her to flow as a river on the earth. Nandini repented and prayed Jabali for mercy . The sage advised her to pray Goddess Shakti to get rid of the curse. Pleased by Nandini's meditation Goddess appeared before Nandini and told her that she has to flow as a river as a result of the curse. She also said that shall be born as her daughter in due course and purify her  from the curse. Nandini emerged as a river from Kanakagiri on the day of Magha Shuddha Poornima and made the earth green once again.

Meanwhile Arunasura acquired a boon from Brahma, that he can not be killed by Gods, Devas, men or women or four legged animals & creatures. He was also blessed with Gayathri Mantra by Goddess Saraswathi which made him invicible.He created havoc and conquered the Heaven. The Devatas, along with Brhama,Siva and Vishnu approached Parashakti for the rescue.

As long as  Arunasura was chanting the Gayathri Mantra no one will able to destroy him. She asked Brihaspathi to distract Arunasura from his meditation of Gayathri so that she would be able to kill him.

Brihaspathi succeeded in diverting Arunasara from his meditation. Parasakthi took the form of Mohini, and Arunasura attracted by her charm  approached her to marry him. When she refused, he became furious. He chased her and  she disappeared inside rock. Arunasura broke the rock with his sword when a swarm of wild bees emerged from the rock and Parasakthi took the form of a giant bee and stung him and eventually killed him. Te releived  Devas and the sages led by Jabali Maharishi performed “Abhishekhams” to Devi with tender coconut brought from the Kalpavriksha of Devaloka, and prayed her to bless the world. Conceding to the request Devi emerged in the form of ‘Linga’ in the middle of the river Nandini and is known as Shree Durga Parameshwari. Nandini was also freed from her curse.
