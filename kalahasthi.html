    <p> Srikalahasteeswara temple in Kalahasti is a Lord Shiva temple in Chitoor district,AP around 40 kms from Tirupathi and 120 kms from Chennai.This is one of the five Pancha Bootha sthalams and represents the Vayu (air).
  </p>
<p>This temple is mentioned in the works of Nakeerar, Thirunavukkarasar(Appar), Sundarar, Sambandar and Manickavasagar in the holy literature Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Devaram, it is one of the  275 <a href="padalpetrasthalam_table.html">Paadal Petra Sthalams </a>.</p>

 
     <p>As per the legends, SriKalahasti is named after a spider (Sri), serpent (kala) and elephant (hasti). <p>The elephant used to clean Shiva Linga by carrying river water with its trunk and decorating the Shiva Linga with Viva leaves.The Spider weaved a thick web daily over the Linga to protect the deity from dust. The serpent used to place Nagamani,a precious gem from Nagalogam, on the Lingas forehead. These three Linga seperately without being aware of what the others wer doing.</p>
<p>One day, the spider had built a very thick web around the deity , while the snake placed its Nagamani gem. The elelphant not aware of this, and thought the cobweb being there is dirty and unclean, poured water and cleaned it. Each were displeased with each of their actions and a war ensued among the three and the snake entered the elephant's trunk and bit him.The distressed elephant banged his trunk and head against the Shiva Lingam. During this chaos, the spider was trampled and squashed by the elephant and the snake also fell out dead. The elephant also eventually died due to the snake's bite.
Lord Shiva then appeared and gave moksha to all of three of them for their selfless bakthi and devotion. </p>
     <p>As per another legend,Vayu performed tapas (penance) for thousands of years to a Karpoora lingam (Lingam nade of camphor).  Shiva appeared before him and asked for his wish. Vayu said he wanted to be omnipresent, and wanted the Karpoora Linganam named after him. Shiva granted his wishes and said that he will be spread throughout this world,and without Vayu, life shall cease to exist. And as per the second wish the Karpoora Lingam shall be worshipped by devas asuras and mortals.</p>
     <p> The story of the hunter Kannappa Nayanar who gave both his eyes by gouging them with his arrow and gave to the Shiva Lingam is also associated with this place. </p>
