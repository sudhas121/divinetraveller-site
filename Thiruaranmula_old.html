<p>Thiruvaranvilai also known as Aranmula, is one of the 108 divya desam temples situated in Chengannur, Kerala. It is around 10 kms from Chengannur railway station.

  </p>


<p>According to the legend , the Pandavas , after crowning Prince Parikshit left on a pilgrimage tour of India. While travelling in the parts now known as Kerala,  these Pandav brothers installed Sri Narayana on the banks of the Pampa and nearby places and offered worship.  It is said  that Arjuna built this temple at a place called Nilackal near Sabarimalai and the idol was brought here in a bamboo raft made of six pieces and hence the name Aranmula (six pieces of bamboo). </p>
<p>During the 18 day Kurukshetra  battle, Karna’s chariot wheel stuck in the ground and while Karna was trying to lift the wheel leaving his weapons in the chariot, Arjuna took the opportunity and killed him. The guilt of killing Karna when unarmed overwhelmed his mind. He came here at the end of the Mahabaratha war to undertake a penance repenting for the killings of his kith and kin, especially his brother Karna. He is said to have hid his weapons under a Vanni tree in this place. Arjuna  got himself absolved of his sins with the grace of Sri Narayana here. </p>
<p>The significance of this sthalam is that the precious ornaments of Sabharimalai Ayyappan are safely kept here. During Makara Jothi, these ornaments are taken from here to Sabarimala to Ayyappan</p>
