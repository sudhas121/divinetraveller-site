<p><strong>Malikapurthuamma</strong> <strong>Temple</strong>
<p>Mahishi, the daughter of Karambaasura ,  had a grouse against Devas for their role in her cousin Mahisasura&rsquo;s death. Mahishi undertook severe penance towards Lord Brahma and obtained a boon from him that an incarnation born to Hari and Hara can only kill her. Blessed by the boon Mahishi deposed Indra and oppressed the Devas.To kill Mahishi, Shri Dharmasastha the son of Shiva (Hara) and Mohini (Hari) took an avatar as Manikantan, the foster son of King Rajasekharan of Pandalam a kingdom in Kerala.</p>
<p>As the Lord danced on the fallen body of Mahishi after killing her, a beutiful woman ,Leela emerged, redeemed from her curse and prayed that she be taken as his consort. The Lord declined her request since he was a bramhachari , but agreed that she being the avatar of <strong>Saraswati, Laxmi and Parvathi</strong> combined would be worshipped at a special shrine. From then onwards she is known as<strong> Malikapurthuamma</strong>.</p>
