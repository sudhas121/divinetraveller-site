<p>Sri Rangam Ranganatha perumal temple is a very important one for the vaishnavites among the 108 divya desams. The temple is situated in between the rivers Cauvery and Kollidam. The temple gopurams (towers) are so huge and majastic that these can be seen from as far as 10kms away as you enter Trichy. </p> 
<p>The temple is considered  as one of the eight <strong/>Sywayambu Kshetras </strong/>of Sri Vishnu where the moolavar( presiding deity) is believed to have manifested on its own. Seven other temples are, Bhoo Varaha Swamy temple in Srimushnam, Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala,Totadri Naadhan Perumal Temple in Nanguneri which are in South India and Varaha Perumal in Pushkar, Badrinaryanan in Badrinath,Chakrapani in Muktinath, Devaraja Perumal Temple in Naimisaranyam are in North India.</p>
<p>According to one legend, Lord Sri Rama,gave the idol of Sri Ranganatha to King Vibhishana after the Lanka war with Ravaanaa. When Vibhishana was returning to Sri Lanka via this holy place, now known as Trichy, the deity wanted to remain in this place,that later became to be known as Sri Rangam.</p><p> You can see the moolavar Ranganathan facing South in his reclining posture, looking towards Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>As per another legend, Vibishana was carrying the idol to Sri Lanka, and while crossing Srirangam, he placed the idol on the banks of Cauvery for taking rest. After performing his daily pooja, he tried to lift the idol, but could not lift.Lord Maha Vishnu appeared to him and said that he would like to stay as Ranganatha in the place that became to be known Srirangam.   </p>

It has 96 pillars each rising to a height of six feet. There are twelve lines of pillars.  The pillars consists of sculptures of rearing horses with riders on their backs and fighting with their hoofs upon the heads of tigers.  You can see a sculpture with the sharp edge of the sword piercing through the tiger’s mouth and is protruding out. Each  pillar has been artistically sculpted. there are many other beautifully carved scuptures on the pillars.Most of the incidents depicted are tales from the Ramayana and Dasavataram. The ten avatars of Vishnu, Krishna leela and a fierce Narsimha are also seen.
