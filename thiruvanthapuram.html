    <p>This is  one the 108 divya desams and a very popular temple situated in Tiruvanthapuram,Kerala. Nammalwar, one among the 12 Vaishnavite saints of the Alvar tradition, has composed ten hymns in praise of Lord Padmanabha during 9th century.</p><p>The origin of the temple of Sree Padmanabhaswamy could not be exactly determined from any historical documents as to when and by who the temple was constructed and by whom the original idol of Sree Padmanabhaswamy was installed and consecrated. The Temple has references in the Epics and Puranas. Srimad Bhagavatha says that Balarama visited this Temple, bathed in the temple pond,Padmatheertham.</p>
     <p>The temple is built in a fusion of the indigenous Kerala style and the Dravidian style  of architecture associated with the temples seen in the state of Tamil Nadu. The temple very closely resemble that of the Adikesava Perumal temple located in <a href="Thiruvattaru.html">Thiruvattar,</a> Kanyakumari District.</p>

 <p> The Temple has nine entrances.
The Temple has a seven storeyed gopuram built on the eastern entrance. It is a fine example of South Indian architecture and is about 35 meters height. On the top there are 7 golden 'kalasams' domes. </p>

<p>The Temple has a marvelous praharam called Sreebalippura. This magnificent rectangular corridor built of stone surrounds the main shrines and it is through this corridor that the Vahanams are taken out during procession. </p> 
     <p>
The Ottakkal (single stone ) Mandapam is in  front of the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Sree Padmanabhaswamy. This structure is built with a single slab of granite which is two and a half feet thick and twenty feet square. The Abhishekams to Sree Padmanabhaswamy are performed in this Mandapam. The granite pillars are covered with gold.Only the King of Travancore may get on to this platform to perform sashtanga namaskaram (prostrate) on this platform. As per tradition, anybody who prostrates on this mandapam has to surrender all that he possesses to the Lord. Since the King has already done that, he is permitted to prostrate on this mandapam.</p>
