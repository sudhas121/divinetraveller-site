   <p> The Mahad temple is another one of the Ashtavinayaka, the eight revered shrines of Ganesha in Maharashtra. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>As per Legend there was this king, Bhima of Koudinyapur the sage Vishwamitra while they had come to forest for penance. He prayed to  Vishwamitra that he may be blessed with a heir as the king was childless. The sage gave the king Ekashar Gajana Mantra to chant and thus his son and heir, prince Rukmaganda was born. Rukmaganda grew up into a beautiful young prince.</p>
<p>One day, on a hunting trip Rukmaganda stopped at the hermitage of Rishi Vachaknavi. The Rishi's wife, Mukunda, fell in love at the sight of the handsome prince and asked him to fulfill her desires. The virtuous prince flatly refused and left the ashram. Knowing her plight, King Indra cunningly took the form of Rukmaganda and courted her. Mukunda became pregnant and gave birth to a son Gritsamada.
In time, when Gritsamada learned of the circumstances of his birth, he cursed his mother to become the unattactive, thorny berry bearing  plant. Mukunda in turn cursed Gritsamada, that a cruel rakshas will be born to him. Suddenly they both heard a heavenly voice saying, "Gritsamada , son of Indra", leaving them both shocked.But due to their curses, Mukunda was transformed into the Bhor plant. Gritsamada felt very bad and retreated to the mythological Pushpak forest where he prayed to Lord Ganesha.</p>
<p>Lord Ganesha was pleased by Gritsamada's penance and offered him a boon that he will bear a son who would not be defeated by anybody other than Lord Shiva. Gritsamada asked Ganesha to bless the forest, and any devotee who pray there will be successful, and also pleaded Ganesha to stay there permanently. Gritsamada built a temple there and the Ganesha idol installed there is called Varadavinayaka. Today the forest is known as Bhadraka.</p>
<p>It is beleived that if the coconut received as prasad during Ganesh chaturthi is consumed, one will be blessed with a son. Hence the temple is especially full with devotees during Ganesh chaturthi.</p>
<p>Like all Ashtavinayaka temples, the Ganesha  is believed to be swayambhu (self-existent), a naturally occurring stone formation resembling an elephant-face</p>

This temple is said to have been built in 1725 AD by Subhedar Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar. There is a beautiful pond beside the temple. The idol of this temple faces the east and has his trunk turned to the left. There is an oil lamp in this shrine which is said to be burning continuously since 1892.
