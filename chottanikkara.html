        <p>The temple is at about 18kms from Ernakulam. Adiparasakthi is worshipped here in three forms, Saraswathy in the morning, Maha Lakshmi at noon and Durgai in the evening. As per legend, the Goddess Saraswathi at the Kollur Mookambika temple in Karnataka, visits Chottanikkara Bhagavathy every morning.  </p>
        <p>As per legend, the present temple was once a dense forest infested with yakshis and rakshas. A tribal named Kannappan used to live in this forest with his family. He was a great devotee of Kali, and would sacrifice a Cow's calf to her every Friday.One day he saw a beautiful black calf,and he stole the calf and took it to the altar. Kannappan's daughter Manimanga came in and begged to him to stop the sacrifice.Kannappan let her keep the calf as a pet. Unfortunately, Manimanga died a few days later due to a snake bite. Kannappan was grief stricken and decided to cremate her body. To his shock, his daughter's dead body had disappeared. A nearby priest told him that abducting calves from the cows for sacrifice was a sin Kannappan and as a curse, he suffered the same fate when his daughter died. However Kannappan went searching for the calf and he found two large stones in its place. The priest told him that the stones could be possibly divine representing Maha Vishnu and Lakshmi, and aske Kannapan to pray before the stones and he would be forgiven for his sins.</p>

       <p> After Kannappan's death, the stones were forgotten. One day a girl cutting the grass, hit a stone with her sickle when the stone started bleeding. The scared girl called the villagers and the local priest,after Deva prasnam, realised that they were divine stones representing Narayan and Lakshmi.</p>
     
        <p>Another legend is that Adi Shankaracharya realised that there were no temple in Kerala for Goddess Maha Lakshmi. He travelled to the Kodachadri hills in Karnataka and meditated for many days for the Goddess to appear before him. Maha Lakshmi appeared befor him and asked Sankara as to what he wanted. He said that he wanted Lakshmi to come with him to Kerala and establish a temple dedicated to her for people to worship.The goddess agreed on a condition that she would follow him by foot wherever he went and  he was not to look behind him to see if she followed him or not. If so,then she would stop there and she will not go any further. He agreed to this and started walking. They were walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and Goddess' anklets sound indicating that she was following him. After some distance Shankar could not hear the sound and looked back.But Lakshmi was following him, and as Sankara broke the condition of not looking back, the Goddess stopped right there. Shankara repented for breaking the condition and repeatedly pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Goddess Lakshmi took pity on him and reached Kerala. In the early hours of morning, she would give darshan at the Chottanikkara temple and  in the afternoon, she would return to Kollur, the spot where she stopped. That place is now where the Mookambika temple is. </p>
