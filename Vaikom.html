     <p>As per the legends an asuran called Khara, a great devotee of Lord Shiva, on receiving the Saiva Vidya Upadesam from Malyavan (great grand father of Ravana), went to Chidambaram and did severe penance for the attainment of moksha. Pleased with his penance Lord Shiva not only granted all the boons he asked for and also and presented him with three great Shiva Lingas. When Khara was returning south from Kailash with the three Lingas carryinng them one in his right hand, one in left hand and other over neck, he felt tired and placed the lingas to rest for awhile. When he tried to pick up the lingas, they wouldn’t move. Khara having attained Moksha then entrusted the Lingas to Maharshi Vyaghrapada who was following him and asked the sage to protect and worship them.</p>

      <p>  It is beleived that the Shiva Linga placed by Khara Asura by his right hand is the one at Vaikom, the one that was in his left hand at Ettumannoor and the one by neck at Kaduthuruthy even today. Getting a  darshan of all these three Lingas on a same day is considered as good as the Shiva darshan at Kailash. </p>
     <p>Sri Parasurama  while travelling through the place and feeling some positive vibrations, noticed a Siva Linga emerging from water, emitting radiance. He realised that it was the Siva Linga placed by Khara. He consecrated the Linga here with recitations of Siva Manthras.

        Lord Siva at once appeared with Parvati Devi before Parasurama. He was pleased that the Linga was consecrated with the Manthras by Parasurama, who is an avatar of Maha Vishnu.

        Ecstatic  Parasurama performed Siva Linga pooja there for some days, then he built a temple here and entrusted to a noble Brahmin of Taruna village to whom he taught the mantras.It is beleived that the temple and all rites and customs are from Parasurama himself.</p>
