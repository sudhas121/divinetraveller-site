     <p> The Srisailam Mallikarjuna temple is situated on a plateau of Nallamalai Hills, around 200 kms from Hyderabad,Andhra Pradesh. Srisailam is one of the most ancient Shiva kshetras in India. As the temple is revered in Devaram, it is one of the  275 <a href="padalpetrasthalam_table.html">Paadal Petra Sthalams </a>. Srisailam is also named as Siridhan, Srigiri, Sirigiri, Sriparvatham and Srinagam.  </p>
     
<p>The molavar (presiding Deity) here is Mallikarjuna Swami and Goddess Bhramaramba Devi. The unique feature of this place is,this is one of the Dwadasa Jyothirlingams(twelve Jyothirlingas) and also one of the 18 Maha Sakthi Peedams as Sati Devi's upper lip is said to have fallen here.

</p>
     <p>As per legends  Silada Maharshi's son Parvatha, is said to have performed a great tapas (penance). When Shiva appeared before him and asked for his wishes,Parvatha wanted Shiva to live on his body. He also asked  Siva that all the Devathas,Devas and sacred waters has to reside on his top and all the devotees visiting this scared place should be given Moksha. Siva granted these wishes of Parvatha. Parvatha then assumed the shape a big hill Srisailam and Siva lives on its top as Sriparvatha Swami. </p>
     <p>According to a literary source, there lived Chandravathi in Chandraguptha Pattana situated near Srisailam. She ran away from her tormenting father and went up the hill and settled there with a few of her servants.One day she saw  one of her cows standing above a rock resembling a Sivalinga and shedding its milk over it. In her dream she came to know that the piece of the stone is none other than a self manifested Linga of God Sriparvatha Swami and statrted worshipping it. Chandravathi offered Jasmine (Mallika)garlands regularly. One day God Siva appeared before her and Chandravathi prayed to him asking him to wear the Jasmine garland (Mallika Pushpamala) in his head permanently. There after Sri Parvatha Swami came to be known as Mallikarjuna Swamy (The one wearing Jasmine flower)</p>
     
  <p><b>The Temple :</b> Before you enter the main temple, the Ganesha temple - Sakshi Ganapathy temple is on the side of the road. This small temple located about 3 km before you reach Srisailam. It is beleived that this Ganapathi in this temple keeps regular account of all the pilgrims to tender ‘Sakshi’ (evidence) of their visit to this temple and hence named as Sakshi Ganapathi. The idol of Ganapathy is is seen holding a book in the left hand and a writing instrument in the right hand to note down the names of the devotees.</p>
     <p>The main temple complex is huge with four Gopurams. The temple complex has many halls or mandapams.The beautiful Mukha Mandapa was built during the Vijayanagar period. The center mandapam ,Nandimandapa, has several pillars, with a huge idol of Nadikeshwara. There are seperate sannidhis for the moolavar (principal deity) Mallikarjuna and Goddess Bhramaramba and several small sannidhis for Vriddha Mallikarjuna, Sahasra Lingeswara, Arthanariswarar, Veerabhadran, Uma Maheswaran etc. </p>    
     
     <p>The Garbagriham (sanctum sanctorum) has a beautiful ornamental entrance. At the centre is the swayambu Jothirlingam. After paying certain fees, devotees can enter and perform abhishekam to this Lingam, which is considered a very divine experience.</p>

She is seen standing on Mahishasuran with her left leg and holding his head with her left hand and piercing it with her Trisulam on her right hand. In her other hands she is seen holding a dagger, mace, sword, a bow, a shield and book. </p>
