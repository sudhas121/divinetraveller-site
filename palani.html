     <p> Palani Dhandayudhapani Swamy Temple of Lord Subramanya is located on top of the Palani Hills,150 kms from Coimbatore and 120 kms from Madurai. It is  one of the six <a href="arupadaiveedu.html" > "Aaru padai veedu" </a> (six abodes of Lord Muruga).</p>
     <p>As per mythology, Sage Narada visited Shiva and Parvathi while they were with their sons Ganesha and younger one Subramanya,at Mount Kailash. Narada had a delicious golden mango on his hand, which he claimed to be the 'Gnana Pazham' (Fruit of Wisdom) and as it can not be cut and given in pieces, he wanted to present the whole fruit to the son whoever circumbulate the earth first. Subramanya scarmbled on his vahana, the peacock and took off.Ganesha, always the wise one, went arount their parents and said they are the world and claimed the fruit. Subramanya returning from circling the earth was furious and in huff left the Kailash and climbed atop the Palani Hills on the earth skulking. No amount of consolation from Shiva and mother Parvathy could convince him to get back to their home. He admonished all his possessions and as a hermit with only a loin cloth and a stick ( dhandam) on his hand and began to meditate to attain wisdom.</p>
     <p>The present idol of Lord Dhandayudhapani is an amalgam of nine various ayervedic mixture called pashanam  and was sculpted and consecrated by siddha sage Bogar.The idol is said to contain medicinal properties that can cure most of the incurable diseases, and some inside miscreants started scraping pieces from the idol in the pretext of touching the idol for abhishekam and alankarams and selling the pashanam. At present even abhishekams to the idol is not done as it is dissolving the idol.</p>

 <p>The temple is built atop the hills of Palani, a portion of the western ghat.It dates back to 9th century and the Cheran king Cheraman Peruman is said to have constructed this temple.There are four approaches to the temple. Traditionally those who are willing to walk the hard way use the 700 steps to ascend to the temple. There is another easier way for pedestrians called 'Anai pathai' (elephant route) of about 3 kms, which is more of a road with easier elevations. Another is the mechanical Winch cars that take you to the top.There is a recently introduced rope car that takes only 3 minutes to cover the distance of 320 metres .

      <p>The outer Praharam is big with beautiful 360 degrees view from the top and you can see the Western Ghats,Idumban Hill, the Kodaikanal Hills,  view of Palani town. On a clear day, the Kurinji Andavar Temple in Kodaikanal can be seen from here. There is a prasadm counter that sells the world famous 'Panchamritham', a must buy for every visitor, similar to that Tirupathi's laddu.</p>
     <p> As you enter the inner sanctum, you can see the majestic Lord Dhanadyudhapani idol which is about 4 feet tall in a pedastal and made of pashanams and other herbs. As constant abhishekams has eroded the idol, no abhishekams are done to this idol, but the smaller bronze idol at the foot of the moolavar. Different alankarams (costumes) such as Sanniyasi alankaram, Vedan (hunter) alankaram,Balasubramaniar alankaram ,Vaitheekal alankaram,Raja alankaram ( like King) and Pushpa alankaram are made from morning till closure in that order.</p>
     <p>As Dhandapani came to Palani as a bachelor there are no sannidhis for his consorts. There is a small sannidhi for Ganesha as you enter the inner sanctum.</p>
     <p>There is a sannidhi for sage and siddhar Bhogar in the southwestern praharam.He is said to have lived long ago around 3000 BC, but no authentic records available. In this sannidhi, pujas are offered to Navadurga, Bhuvaneswari and Maragatha Lingam that were worshipped by Bhogar. It is said that there is an underground tunnel linking this sannidhi with the sanctum sanctorum through which Bhogar is said  perform daily pujas to Lord Dhandayudhapani.</p>
    

<p>Hymns in praise of Lord Palani Murugan have been sung by Saint Arunagirnathar in Tiruppukazh.</p>



    
     
 <div></div>
<strong>Rituals</strong>
<p>Devotees offer their hair ( it is very popular in Tirupathi Balaji temple, and other Murugan temples in the South) as a sacrifice after their prayers have been answered. You can request the authorized barber to come to your place of stay to perform tonsuring to you or your kids in a more hygienic conditions. </p>
     <p> There is a Golden cradle in the temple. Devotees place their child on it on a payment of small fees,for well being of their child.</p>


 <p>Other important ritual is carrying of palkudams (milk pots) and Kavadi by the devotees in huge numbers.</p> 
     

<p> The temple has a golden chariot made of gold and silver and other metals. Devotees on payment of stipulated fees can take the deity in a procession in the golden charriot around the outer corridor.</p>
     <p><b>Panchamritham</b> The Panchamritham available here used to be very famous with five main ingredients, hill banana,jaggery,ghee,raisins,dates and kalkandu(rock candies). Now there are so many players selling this as prasadam, which maybe inferior to the original one.</p>

<p><strong>Festivals</strong></p>
<p>Daily pujas to the deities are performed six times a day.</p>
<p>Monthly Krithikai festival, Visakam festival in May, Navarathri festival in May, the important Skanda Sashti festival during October,Thiru Karthikai in Nov/December, Thai poosam in January and Pankuni Uttiram in Pankuni (March-Apr) are celeberated in a very grand scale.
