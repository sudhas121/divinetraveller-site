<p> As per legend,Sage Pundareeka was performing penance here.  He saw beautiful lotus flowers in a tank nearby and wanted them to be placed at the feet of Lord Narayana in Tiruparkadal (in the Heavenly abode where no mortal can reach). So obsessed with the thought of offering the lotus flowers to Lord Narayana at Thiruparkadal, he collected 1008 flowers and  he started wading through through the sea water he began scooping out the water to dry the sea by removing the water chanting Narayana,Narayana.His mind was completely set on offering the flowers to the Lord before they wilted. <p> Lord Narayana appeared before him as an old fragile man.The old man asked sage Pundareeka for food. The old man also said that the sage being a fool to try to drain the water by his hands to reach the Lord in Thiruparkadal. Pundareeka said that he will not rest till he offered the flowers to Lord Narayana, and he asked the old man to hold his flower basket and wait there till he brought food. Pundareeka went to his home nearby to bring food for the old man. By the time he returned, Lord wore all the flowers as a garland and was resting in a reclining posture, thus giving Pundareeka darshan as seen in Thiruparkadal and accepting the flowers as Pundareeka wished. </p>
