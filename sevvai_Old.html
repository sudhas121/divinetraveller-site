<p> The temple is located 13 Kms from Mayiladudurai towards Sirkazhi, and 6 Kms from Sirkazhi. This is known to be the sthalam for the presiding deity Angarakan  (Chevvai in Tamil for Planet Mars), one of the nava grahas. However, the main deity in the temple is that of lord Shiva known here as Vaidhyanata swamy who is said to have arrived as a Vaidyan (physician or doctor), heeding to the prayers of Angarakan (Mars) who was suffering from leprosy. Vaidhyanata swamy consort is Thaiyalnayaki. </p>
 
<p>The temple is on the main road . Lord Shiva as Vaidhyanatha swamy is a swayambu in the temple. The five Gopurams of the temple are on a straight line. Navagrahas are behind the sanctum on a straight line, placed side by side, which is an unique feature here. As you enter you come across two flagposts, one coated with silver and the other with gold. In the north you see the sannithi for Avudaiamman and towards east is the important shrine of Lord Muruga,here called as Selva Muthukumaran. After having a darshan of Ganapathy, you proceed for the shrine of Vaidhyanatha Swamy situated facing the West. There is a sepearte shrine for ambal Thayalnayagi faceing South. As you come around Sri Vaidhyanatha swamy shrine you can see the shrines of Selva Muthukumar, Gajalakshmi, Nataraja, Dakshinamurthy, Sattanathar, the Jadayu kundam and the utsava murthy of Angarakan </p>

<p>In front of the ambal Thaiyalnayaki sannithi is the holy tank called 'sidhamrutha theertham'. A dip here at the tank is beleived to have a curing effect for all type of ailments, especially skin ailments. Angarakan is said to have bathed here for forty five days to get his leprosy cured. It is customary that devotees buy jaggery and dissolve it in the tank. Another ritual here is to offer salt and pepper to ambal Thayalnayaki.  People also offer tiny body parts made of silver sheets to cure of their ailments, like devotees offer, leg or hand to cure ailments of their leg or hand, chest to cure ailments related to respiratory problems. <p> During the night pooja to Sri Selva Muthukumar, a sandal paste along with saffron is applied to the fore head of the Lord called 'Nethra pidi santhanam', and this is considered as a very valuable prasad. Another prasad from Sri Vaidhyanatha swamy called 'Thiru Chandu urundai' are small pellets (urundai) which were beleived to have been given to Angarakan to cure his leprosy. This can be consumed by the devotees.Both these are revered and is said to be medicines for the ailments.<p>Rama and Lakshmana is said to have cremeated Jadayu here after he was killed by Ravana.</p>

<p> In the south there is a sepearte shrine for Angarakan. He is seen with his consorts Malini and Suseelini.<p> There is also a shrine to the divine healer, Dhanvantari in this temple.</p>


 <p>People pray here  for removal of Sevvai dosha which generally affects their health, marital happiness, property loss,injuries and other malicious effects. It is beleived that fasting on Tuesdays, and performing abhishekams during rahu kalam, offering red vastras, offering red flowers, coral will please Angarahan and your chevvai doshams are alleviated.</p>

 <p>  This Shiva Temple is praised in Thevaram and Tirupugazh hymns by saints such as Tirugnana Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Arunagirinathar, Kumara Guruparar, Chidambara Munivar, Ramalinga Adigal, and Kalamega Pulavar .   </p>
 <br/>
   <b>Festivals</b>
 </p>
 <p>Usually crowded during Tuesdays and pradoshams. Ten days Thai festival dedicated to Lord Selva Muthukuraswami with daily procession during January-February, twnent eight days Panguni Brahmmotsavam , six  days Aipasi Skanda Sashti during October-November are some of the important festivals here</p>
 
 <p><strong>Special offerings</strong></p>
 <p>As mentioned earlier it is customary that devotees buy jaggery and dissolve it in the tank.( to control the pollution, the temple has asked the devotees to put the jaggery pieces in the bin placed near the tank). Another ritual here is to offer salt and pepper to ambal Thayalnayaki. ( My suspicion is the salt and pepper reused !) People also offer tiny body parts made of silver sheets to cure of their ailments, like they offer, leg or hand to cure ailments of their leg or hand, chest to cure ailments related to respiratory problems./p>
