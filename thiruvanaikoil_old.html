<p> Jambukeswarar Temple,Thiruvanaikaval is a sacred saivite shrine of Shiva located in Thiruvanaikaval also known as Thiruvanaikal,Tamil Nadu, a suburb of Trichy,on the northern banks of the Cauvery river adjacent to Srirangam. It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams ( Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar saints Tirunavukkarasar, Thirugnana Sambandar and Sundarar). The name of the Lord here is Jambukeswarara and the name of the Goddess is Akilandewari Amman.</p><p>Thiruvanaikaval is one of the Pancha Bootha Sthalams (five holiest Shiva temples), each representing one of the five natural elements. Thiruvanaikaval represents water (appu) hence this is called as Appusthalam. The other four temples are Nataraja temple,Chidambaram representing akasha (upper sky), Ekambareswara (earth) at Kanchipuram, Arunachaleswara or Annamalai (fire)at Thiruvannamalai and Kalahasti Nathar (wind) at Kalahasti.</p>
<p>There is a freshwater spring underneath the main deity of Shiva Lingam ,which has a perennial flow. </p><p>As per one legend,Paravathi was asked to go to earth to do a penance by Shiva. Parvathi in the form of Akilandeswari came  to the Jambu forest, now known as Thiruvanaikal,made shiva Linga out of water from river Cauvery under a Naaval tree (Jambu tree).Pleased with her penance,Shiva appeared and gave darshan to Akilandeswari.</p>  <p>As per another legend, two Siva Ganas 'Malyavan' and 'Pushpadanta', who were always quarelling and  fighting  each other. One day Ganam Malyavan cursed Ganam Pushpadanta to become an elephant on earth.Pushpadanta in turn cursed Malyavan to become a spider on earth. Both came to Jambukeswaram and continued their Shiva worship. The elephant collected water from river Cauvery and bathed the Lingam under the Jambu tree daily.Ganam Malyavan as spider, constructed a web over the lingam to prevent dry leaves from the jambu tree dropping on the Lingam. When the Ganam Pushpadanta in elephant form saw the web ,removed the cobwebs and cleaned the Lingam by pouring water and the practice continued daily. Ganam Malyavan spider became angry and bit the elephant to death, and the spider also was killed. Shiva moved by the  devotion of the two Ganas, relieved them from the curse. As an elephant worshipped Shiva here, this place came to be known as Thiru Aanai Kaa (forest of holy elephant). Later the name 'Thiruaanaikaa' became 'Thiruvanaikaval' and 'Thiruvanaikoil'.</p>
        <p>
In the next birth, the spider was born as the King Kochengot Chola  and built 70 temples and this temple is the one among them. Remembering his previous birth enmity with the elephant, he built the Shiva Sannidhi below ground level with a very small entrance so no elephants can enter. You can observe that the entrance  of Jambukeswara sannidhi is only 4 foot high and 2.5 foot wide.</p>  <br/>

  <strong> The Temple: </strong></p> The temple at Tiruvanaikaval is a big one covering an area of about 18 acres with high walls and gopurams on all the 4 sides.There are five praharams (corridors). The outer wall of the fifth praharam is massive, stretches over a mile and is two feet wide and over 25 feet in height. Legend says that the wall was built by Shiva himself working alongside the laborers. The fourth praharam has a huge mandapam with 796 pillars. It  has a pushkarani (temple tank) fed by perpetual springs.  The inner most praharam  has the sanctum.The shrine for mother Akilandeswari is situated in the fourth praharam.
 </p>
  <p>The main sannidhi is situated below ground level and you have to descend three steps from the sannidi entrance. The moolavar deity can  viewed through a stone window that has nine openings. Entrance into the sannidhi is through a small door  about 4 feet in height. Devotees are admitted in groups of five to six into the sannidhi or on payment of a small fee, if it is crowded. The  lingam of Jambukeswarar is said  to be swayambu (self manifested). The height of the lingam is about 3 feet from the floor of the sanctum. A water spring is said to emerge from the lingam, which we can see by the wetness of the vastrams adorning the Shiva Lingam. The water flow increases significantly during the rainy season. The only source of illumination within the sannidhi are the ghee lamps,which gives the devotees a divine glow of the moolavar.  </p>
  <p>The deities of Jambukeswarar and Akilandeswari are installed opposite to each other.  The sannadhi of the  Akilandeshwari and the sannadhi of Prasanna Vinayaka are in the shape of the pranava manthra symbol "Om". It is believed  during one of Adi Sankara's visit he installed the Prasanna Ganapathy idol right opposite to her sannidhi and installed a pair of Sri Chakra thadangas (ear rings) to pacify an angry Goddess Akilandeswari and to ensure that she remains in a Sowmya and Shantha Roopam.
