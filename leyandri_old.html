<p> The Lenyandri temple is another one of the Ashtavinayaka, the eight revered shrines of Ganesha in Maharashtra. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>According to the Ganapatya scripture Ganesha Purana, Ganesha incarnated as Mayuresvara or Mayureshwar, who had six arms and a fair complexion. He was born to Shiva and Parvati in the Treta yuga, for the purpose of killing the demon Sindhu.His mount was a peacock.
Once Parvati (Girija) asked her husband Shiva who he was mediating on.  Desiring to have a son, Parvati performed a penance for twelve years in the caves of Lenyadri. Pleased by her penance, Ganesha blessed her with the boon that he will be born as her son. On the fourth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month Bhadrapada - Purattasi(Ganesh chaturthi day), Parvati worshipped an image of Ganesha made of clay, which came alive. Thus, Ganesha was born to Parvati at Lenyadri. Later, he was named Gunesha by Shiva meaning one who has three qualities Satva, Raja and Tama under his control. For 15 years Gunesha grew up at Lenyadri. Sindhu, who knew that his death would be at the hands of Gunesha, sent demons like Krur, Balasur, Vyomasur, Kshemma, Kushal, and many more, to kill Gunesha, but all of them were instead killed by him.</p> <p>At the age of six, the architect God Vishwakarma worshipped Gunesha and endowed him with the weapons Pasha (noose), Parashu (axe), Ankusha (hook) and Padma (Lotus). Once, little Gunesha knocked an egg from a mango tree, from which emerged a peacock. Gunesha mounted the peacock and assumed the name Mayureshwara. <a href="morgaon.html" > Mayureshwar </a> later killed Sindhu and his army at <a href="morgaon.html"> Morgaon,</a> the most important Ashtavinayaka temple.</p>
<p>The Ganesha form worshipped here is called Girijatmaja. The name is implies as "mountain-born" or as "Atmaja of Girija", the son of Parvati. The features of the Ganesha idol, seen on the back wall of the cave, are the least distinct when compared to the other Ashtavinayak temples. Though the temple faces the south, according to a local tradition,the deity faces north, with his back to his worshipper and his face visible on the other side of the mountain. It is said that the Peshwa rulers even tried to locate the face of Ganesha on the other side.   Ganesha is seen with his trunk turned to the left side, facing east, with one of his eyes visible. The icon is covered with sindoor and is directly formed on the stone wall of the cave.
Like all Ashtavinayaka temples, the Ganesha  is believed to be swayambhu (self-existent), a naturally occurring stone formation resembling an elephant-face</p>

<p> The word 'lena' means a cave and the suffix 'adri' in Sanskrit means a mountain.Shri Girijatmaj Lenyadri Ganapati is the only Ganesh Temple which is carved in caves. Mytholgy says that when the  Pandavas were living in exile , they sculptured these caves in just one night. There are 28 caves here, stretching from east to west. The temple occupies the complete 7th cave which gives a broad look to the temple.These caves became dwelling for Buddhist monks, mostly with meditation cells, an unpillared hall with 20 cells with varying dimensions.  307 steps built by devotees in stone masonry over eight flights lead to the entrance. The veranda has six pillars and two half-pillars, that support the beams and rafters. </p>

There are 2 windows on either side of the entrance. The hall is treated now as a sabha mandapa ("assembly hall") of the Ganesha temple. To maintain and preserve the archeological values, there is no electricity here. Temple is so constructed that natural light falls in to the temple.</p>
