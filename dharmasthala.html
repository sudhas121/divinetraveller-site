    <p> The Dharmasthala Temple is a beautiful, historic temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and is situated around 65 kms from Mangalore. This is temple is very famous and a pioneer in Annadhanam (feeding the mass). The modern, hygienic, automated kitchen of this temple has been designed to feed 30,000 to 70,000 pilgrims on any given day. Padma Vibhushan Shri D.Veerendra Heggade,who is the Dharmadhikari (CEO), is instrumental behind this eco friendly kitchen and its operations.The kitchen and the food preparation process, serving food to thousands was recently featured on National Geographic channel as one of the most efficient and resourceful mass kitchens of India. </p>

     <p>The history of the temple dates back to 800 years. Dharmasthala was known as Kuduma, where lived a village chief called Birmanna Pergade and his wife Ammu Ballalthi in a house called Nelyadi Beedu. They were pious and affectionate couple known for their generosity and hospitality .</p>

<p>According to legend, four Dharma devadais (guardian angels) Kalarahu, Kalarkai, Kumaraswamy and Kanyakumari  arrived at Pergade’s home as mortals in search of a place where Dharma was being practiced .The Pergade couple hosted these adithis (guests) with all their humility and hospitality. Pleased by their sincerity that night the Dharma devadas appeared in the dreams of Birmanna Pergade, asked him to vacate his house for the worship of the God Dharma and dedicate his life to the propagation of Dharma.Without hesitation, the Pergade moved out of his house and began worshipping the Deities at Nelyadi Beedu. This continues even today.</p>
     <p>These Dharma devas appeared in Pergade's dream and asked him to construct seperate shrines for them. Pergade built the shrines and invited brahmin priests to perform the temple rituals. These priests requested Pergade to also install a Shivlinga beside the native devadais. A local person serving Pergade called Annappa Swamy was sent to procure the idol of Lord Manjunatheshwara from Kadri, near Mangalore. Later, Shree Manjunatha Swamy temple was built around this idol.</p>
     <p>Around the 16th century, Shri Devaraja Heggade, the chief care taker of the temple in the Pergade family lineage, invited Shri Vadiraja Thirtha of Udupi to visit the place. Swami Vadiraja sensed that idol of Lord Manjunatha had not been consecrated according to the agama sastras (vedic rites). Shri Heggade then requested the Swamiji to reconsecrate the Shiva Linga himself. The Swamiji named the place Dharmasthala meaning the abode of religion and charity. The charity work established by the Pergades 800 years ago have been nurtured and maintained by 21 generations of the Heggade family. </p>
