<p>The Parthasarathy temple is in the heart of Chennai, in Triplicane.  It is one among the 108 divyadesams. Lord Krishna is worshipped in the name ‘Parthasarathy’ in this temple, a Sanskrit word meaning ‘charioteer of Partha ( Arjuna) ’. It is said that Veda Vyasa rishi who wrote Mahabaratha longed to see SriKrishna as the chariot driver and Krishna Himself gave the Maharishi a figurine of Himself in the chariot driver getup. 
<p>A king by name Sumathi, showered his love toward the Lord Balaji of Thirumala. But he wished to worship Lord Balaji as Lord Krishna. To grant his wish, Vankatesa Perumal appeared in front of the king as Lord Krishna at this place in the pose which he stood in the Mahabharatha war, hence called as Venkata Krishnan. 

 <p>The Moolavar of this sthalam is Venkata Krishnan. Along with Rukmani , he holds sword in one hand, Varadha Muthirai on the other hand and his brother Balaraman on his right, Sathaviki on his left, son Prathyumnan, Grand son Aniruthan are also found near the Moolavar. This is one of the Sthalam where the Lord shows his seva along with his three generations. He is found in standing (Nindra thirukkolam) position and facing  towards East direction.  <p>He is seen exactly as he was in the Kurushetra war as the chariot driver and the as The One who preached the Baghavat Gita to Arjuna who was reluctant to participate in the war. He is seen with a majestic moustache as was the tradition of the Yadava clan, a darshan you can get nowhere!  The characterstic SriChakra of the Lord Vishnu is not seen here as he had kept his promise to Duriyodhan not take part in the Mahabarath war. </p>
 <p> In front of the moolavar is the utsavar Partasarthy with His consorts Sridevi and Bhoodevi. The utsaver Parthasarathy  has scar marks in His face that symbolises the wounds afflicted by Bheeshsma's arrows while Krishna was driving Arjuna's chariot during the Kurushetra war .
