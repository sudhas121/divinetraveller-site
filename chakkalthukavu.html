    <p>The temple that dates back to almost 3000 years. This area where the temple stands now had been a dense forest. It is located around 12 kms from Thiruvalla. This is popularly known as 'Ladies Sabarimala'.  </p>

     <p>As per the legends two demons Sumbha and Nishumbha acheived super powers through rigorous meditation of Lord Brahma and received a boon that they could be killed only through a battle with a woman. Drunk with power, Sumbha and Nishumbha conquered Indra and other Devas. They conquredr the three worlds and the helpless Devas  had to flee away and take shelter in remote jungles.</p>

<p>The Devas approached Brahma for a solution to save them. Brahma was helpless and said only Parvathi Devi can save them. Deva went in search of Goddess Parvathi. 
Goddess Parvathy had just arrived on the banks of river Ganga when she heard the pleading sounds of Devas. Goddess Parvathy reincarnated as  Goddess Durga, 
and a big war between the Goddess and all Asuras under  Sumba and Nishumbha ensued. All the asuras were annihilated by the Goddess Durga and the Devas got their rightful places and peace prevailed.

It is believed that the Goddess residing in Chakkulathukavu is a wholesome reincarnation of Parvathi as Goddess Durga.</p>
    

  <p><b>The Temple :</b> The temple is situated in a big sprawling space.There is a big Dwajasthamba in front of the entrance. We can two massive statues of two tuskers on each side, said to be elephants of this temple. The sanctum or the karpa graha of Chakkulathuamma has no roof over the Goddess. There are sannidhis for Ganesha, Shiva,Sastha,Subramanya,Yakshi,Naga,Anai Marudha and navagrahas. There is a sannidhi for Baghavathy,Sarsawathi and Raaghu called Sarswathi mandapam where abishekams can be performed by the devotees. River Pamba and River Manimala flow on the two sides of Chakkulathukavu temple.</p> 
 <b>Important Festivals</b>    
<p><b>Chakkulathukavu Pongala</b>
This is a famous and important festival in the temple during the month of ‘Vrischikam’ (November- December).  The temple premises will be overcrowded and the devotees arrange place for offering the Pongal on both sides of the mains streets. The queue sometimes extends to a length of several kilometers.

<p>Rice, coconut and jaggery are bought by women devotees along with earthen pots for cooking. The Chief Priest lights the firepalce from a fire from inside the sanctum sanctorum.  Every year at the time of lighting the main hearth (cooking fire place) an eagle is found to circle above the sky. It is believed that the Goddess Durga herself is present near each Pongala hearth as the cooking is done. 
 
 According to the devotees all the griefs, problems solved and illness of the devotees are cured through the Pongal offering.

  <b>Nari Pooja</b>
    <p> Several decades ago, ladies were not allowed in this temple.A very old lady pleaded with the priest that she wanted to stand in a corner and wanted to darshan the Goddess and witness the pooja. She was mercilessly chased away. As soon as she left, there were heavy rains,gusty winds uprooting the trees. Lamps and the temple kalasams broke in the gust. The priest realised that this was not a good omen and performed deva prasanam (a type of astrolgy) and found out that the ols was none other than the Goddess Durga herself. The priest was upset and prosrtated before the Goddess seeking forgiveness.</p><p>Devi Chakkulathma asked the priest to perform pooja for the ladies visiting the temple on the same day by washing their feet. Among thousands of women coming on that day, she  will be also one among them.</p>
     <p> This Nari pooja is performed every year sometime during December by the head priest.During that day no male members shall be allowed inside</p>
     
     <p><b>Kashayam as prasadam</b>Every Friday a herbal concoction called Kashayam is used for abishekam to Goddess Chakkulathamma and distributed as prasad. It is beleived to cure ailments and people throng to obtain this. </p>
