    <p> The Kailasanathar Temple is situated in the village of Thingalur, 18 kilometres from Kumbakonam. This is known to be sthalam for the presiding deity Chandran (Soma or moon), one of the navagrahas. However, the main deity in the temple is that of lord Shiva known here as Kailasanathar.</p>
 <p> Historical facts narrates the divine facts abouts Thingalur. In the seventh century , Tamil poet-saint, one of the most prominent of the sixty-three nayanmars, Appar also known Thirunavukkarasar visted Thingalur. Thirunavukkarasar was surprised to see padasalas (schools), hospitals, travellers lodges, roads in that village were bearing his name. He came to know that the village headman called Apputhi adigal, a staunch devotee of Thirunavukkarasar, was behind these. Amazed at his devotion,he wanted to visit him. Apputhi adigal welcomed hime home and asked him to have lunch along with his disciples. Thirunavukkarasar accepted his invitation and said that he will be back after visiting the Kailasanathar temple.</p>
 <p> Meanwhile, in the home of Apputhi adigal, his wife was preparing a grand feast and asked their son, Navukkarasu, to get plantain leaves from the garden to serve the guests. In the back yard Navukkarasu was bitten by a cobra and he succumbed to the venom. The grieving Appudhi adigal and his wife hid his body, fearing that Thirunavukkarasar will refuse to eat if he came to know about this. Thirunavukkarasu and his disciples came back from the temple ,had their food and Thirunavukkarasar asked wherabouts of his son.The couple could not control their grief and revealed that their son is dead because of the snake bite. Shocked Thirunavukkarasar asked them to take their child to the Kailasanathar temple. There Thirunavukkarasar sang a verse and the boy got up as if from sleep. Such is the greatness of this place</p>
   
    
   
     
     <p>Chandran is said to be the grandson of Brahma, born to his son Athri and wife Anusuya. Puranas also says that Chandran was born out of 'paar kadal' while it was being churned for the 'amudham' (nectar of life).  Datchan, one of his fathers in law cursed Chandran to lose his beauty and glamour as he was biased towards one of his wife Rohini, ignoring the rest of his twnty seven wives.</p>
<p>He prayed to Lord Shiva and he restored his beauty saying that he will regain his figure slowly in a fortnight. But because of the curse he wanes every fifteen days. The waxing and waning of the Moon is due to this.</p>
<p>As you enter the temple, in the left side you can see the snactum for Suryan. As you proceed towards south, you can see the sanctum of mother goddess Periyanayaki facing south. As you walk clockwise from there you can see ganapathy,Subramanya,Dakshinamurty, Gajalakshmi, Chandikeswarar and Bhairavar. In the sanctum sanctorum ,Lord Shiva here called Kailasanthar bless the devotees facing east.</p>
<p> Close to that sannithi, we can see the sannithi for Chandran. praying to Chandran here will reduce the bad influence of Moon and the devotees are blessed and releived of their sufferings.</p>
 

 <p>People pray here  for removal of obstacles in marriage proceedings, for child birth and excelling in education.</p>
