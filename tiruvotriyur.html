     <p> As per legends Lord Shiva took the form a huge fire to make the water recede during the 'Pralayam' ( the colossal flooding of the earth) and he stayed here as a Swayambu lingam under a Makizhampoo tree. As he helped water to recede (vatra in Tamil), this place may have been vcalled as Thiru Vatriyur ,now Thiruvotriyur.It is beleived that this is the first Swayambu lingam (self manifested) that appeared in the earth after the Pralayam, the lord here is named “Adhipureeswarar” (Adhi, the first).</p>
     <p> As per another legend ,two demons Madhu and Kaithaba stole the Vedas, hid them in the bottom of the sea. Devas went to Lord Mahavishnu to recover the Vedas. After worshiping Lord Shiva here, Mahavishnu reinvarmnated himself as a Koorma avatar and brought the Veda back to this place. Lord Shiva sanctified the Vedas again and restored them to the devas.</p>
<p>As per another legend,serpent Vasuki (king of serpants), had worshiped Lord Shiva here. Impressed by Vasuki's devotion, it is believed that Lord Shiva appeared from the ant hill,and presented him an ornament for his neck. Hence the lord here is called Otreeswarar and Padampakkanathar. </p>
