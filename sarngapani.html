     <p>The Sarngapani Temple, (note: it is not SARANGApani) is located in Kumbakonam of Tamil Nadu, India, situated in between Cauvery and Arisalar rivers. The temple is one of the 108 Divya Desams.As per legend sage Hema Rishi performed penance in the bank of Potramarai (Golden lotus)tank to be blessed with  Goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. Sri Maha Vishnu was pleased by the penance and Hema rishi's wish was granted and Lakshmi emerged out of the Potramarai tank among thousand lotuses and was thus named Komalavalli (the one who emerged from lotus).  Later Sriman Narayana descended to earth as Aravamudhan in a chariot drawn by horses and elephants from his abode Vaikuntam. He stayed in the near by Someswaran Temple to marry Her and the couple eventually got married.</p> <p> The name Sarngapani is derived from Sarnga the bow of Sri Rama and pani meaning hand - the one holding the bow in his hand is Sarngapani.</p>
<p>
There is another story related to this temple. Once there was a dispute between the rishis as to whom to give more importance among "Sivan, Bhrama and Vishnu". 
As they couldn't resolve the matter they sent Brighu Maharishi to test and Brighu Maharishi went to Siva logam and Bhramalogam and was dishonored by them. Seething with anger, he went at last to the place of Maha Vishnu. 
There too he was not received properly. He got very angry and kicked Maha Vishnu in his chest where Godess Mahalakshmi lives. But, Mahavishnu took the feet which kicked him and said that it was an honor that his foot had touched him, and saying so he took away the third eye of Brighu Maharishi which was under his right toe. 
Brighu Maharishi regained his temper and also lost his eye of Pride and he became very humble and pleaded Maha Vishnu to forgive him. Meanwhile, as Bhrigu Maharishi had kicked Maha Vishnuâ€™s chest where Mahalakshmi lived, she got upset and angry and left Maha Vishnu and  came to the earth to live in Kolhapur. 
Without Mahalakshmi the Goddess of wealth, Lord Narayana was worried and came to earth in search of her. But as he could not find her, he transformed himself into Lord Srinivasa and married Goddess Padmavathi. Padmavathidevi had a dispute with Lord Srinivasa and left Tirupati and stayed at Tiruchanur. Meanwhile, Mahalakshmi who was staying at Kolhapur came to know the news of Lord Srinivasa's marriage from Narada. She became very angry and started to search Lord Srinivasa who had fled to the paathala loga (abyss) in Kumbakonam, to escape from Mahalakshmi's anger. 
Goddess Mahalakshmi searched for Lord Srinivasa everywhere but could not find Him. So she became a small child and crawled as Bala Komalavalli in the Potramarai Kulam. Then Sriman Narayan descended to the earth in a chariot drawn by horses and elephants and married Komalavalli. Mahalakshmi later repented her mistake of leaving the Lord and vowed to never again leave him. Hence she became to be known as "Padi Thanda Pathini". ( The wife who will not cross the door step) </p>
<p> There is a "Paadhala Srinivasar" in this temple which is related to the above tale. </p>

 <p>As per a legend, once there lived a devotee called Lakshmi Narayanswamy and he was great devotee of Aravamudhan and spent most of his life to the service of the deity.He was the one who built the Rajagopuram of the temple.
