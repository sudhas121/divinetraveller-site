    <p>Trimbak town is near Nasik,Maharshtra ,located at the source of the Godavari River and is the place of one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The Jyotirlinga  here is the form of a three faced, embodying Trimurthis, Brahma,  Vishnu and  Shiva.</p>
<p> As per one legend, Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority and asked Lord Shiva to be judge. Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his feet and his head. Vishnu tok the form of a boar(Varaha), and tunneled through the earth to find the source of the fire and Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame.  As neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the origin and end of the fire,Vishnu gracefully accepted his defeat, but Brahma lied and said that he had found the crown of the fire. Knowing that Brhama was lying, Shiva cursed Brahma that he would never have temples on earth in his worship.On the request of Vishnu and Bramha, Siva who was in the form of a fire, took the form of a Shivalingam at the foot of the hill Brahmagiri, which is where the Trimbakeswarar Temple is located. Brahmagiri, a sacred hill from which three separate sources of the Godavari River emerge, flowing east is called Godavari, flowing south is Vaitarna, and the third is called the flowing towards west is Ganga, which meets the Godavari near Chakra Thirth. The river Ahilya also meets the Godavari in front of the Trimbakeshwar Temple.
