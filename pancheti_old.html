The history of the temple dates back to more than 1000 years.  The legend behind the temple goes like this - Once the three sages Vasishtar,Gauthamar and Kalvar were looking for a place to do their penance. They went to Brahma and requested him to show them such a place. Brahma then made awheel made of dharba grass and rolled it. It rolled and rested in a place and Brahma indicated that particular place is  good for them to perform their penanace. The place indicated by Brahma is beleived to be this Panchishti </p>
<p> Panch meaning five and ishti means Yagna. As per legends, there was a 'Yatchan' (demon king) called Sukethu, who was cursed by Lord Subramanya to be born as an Asura, for showing his arrogance towards Shiva and Parvathy. Sukethu later married an Asura woman and gave birth to three boys. These boys who came to know about the curse of the father, did a penance towards Goddess Parvathi and became powerful. They then started teasing the devas with their strength. Devas then went and complained to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva directed Sage Agastiyar to teach a lesson to Sukethu. Meanwhile Sukethu after losing a battle with three asuras went and hid under the sea. Sukethu's sons  went in search of his father deep into the thus destroying the sea lives and creating a lot of commotion. Sage Agastiyar to curb the mischievous sons of Sukethu, drank all the sea thus trapping the three sons and Sukethu in his stomach. The earth became dry and Devas pleaded to restore the sea. Sage Agastya restored the sea by spitting the sea back in its place.He also spat some remaining water in his  mouth in Pancheshti and the pond here in the temple is known as 'Agasthya Theertham'.</p><p>Sukethu and his sons pleaded to Sage Agasthya to pardon them and releive them of their curse. To get him relieved of the curse, Sage Agasthiyar performed about 5 yagnas called Deva Yaagam, Brahma Yaagam, Bhootha Yaagam, Pithur Yaagam and Manusha Yaagam here. Hence this place got its name Pancha Ishti which later became as Pancheshti and now colloquially called Panchetti.  </p>
