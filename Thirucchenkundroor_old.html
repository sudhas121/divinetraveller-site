<p>According to legends, there was a demon called Padmasuran. He did a severe penance towards Lord Shiva and got a boon that if he (Padmasuran) touches any one's head, they will turn to ash. Lord Shiva pleased with Padmasuran's penance, granted him the boon. As soon as he got the boon, he wanted to test it on Lord Shiva Himself, and he came running to touch Shiva's head. Shiva had no other option but to retreat himself and hide from Padmasuran.</p><p> With such a powerful boon, Padmasuran wreaked terror and people were afraid to come near him.</p><p>Lord Shiva approached Sri Narayana for His help. Sri Narayana took the avatar of Mohini and went before Padmasuran. Padmasuran who fell for Mohini's beauty wanted to court her. Mohini asked padmasuran to have an oil bath first before touching her. A very happy Padmasuran went towards a pond and started applying oil on his body. As soon as he touched his head, he turned into ashes and died. Sri Narayana saved Lord Shiva and gave  prathyaksham for Shiva at this place.</p>
<p> Another legend according to local people here is that Dharmaputran (Yudishtran) , during the Mahabharth war, he uttered 'Aswathama hatha' loudly and 'kunjara' feebly, meaning Ashwathma has been killed ( kunjara meaning an elephant). On hearing this word from Dharmar,and knowing that Dharmar will never lie, Dhronacharya, father of Ashwatma was shocked and laid down his arms,beleiving his son Ashwatma was killed. Seeing this opportunity, Pandavas slained him. Dharmar repented very much and considered himself responsible for Dhronacharya's death. To wash away this sin, he constructed a temple for Sri Narayana at this place and prayed to absolve his sins. Because of his sincere prayers and heartfelt repentence, Sri Narayana absolved him of his sins. <p> It is beleived that any one who comes and prays Lord Imayavarappan here will be absolved of their sins.</p>
