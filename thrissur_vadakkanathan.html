     <p>Vadakkunnathan Temple is situated in Thrissur, Kerala.The name Thrissur is from 'Thiru-Shiva-Peroor', which means  "the city of the sacred Shiva". Thrissur was also known as Vrishabhadripuram and Thenkailasam or Dakshina Kailasam in ancient days. This temple is a classic example of the architectural style of Kerala situated in a sprawling area of several acres.This is said to be the first Shiva temple created by Lord Parasurama.  </p>
     <p>Adi Sankara is believed to have been born to the Shivaguru and Aryamba of Kalady in answer to their prayers before Vadakkunnathan, as an avatar (incarnation) of the Lord shiva. </p>

    <p>The place where Shiva first manifested as swayambu as a lingam is the Sri Moola Sthana at the foot of a huge banyan tree.For many years, the lingam remained at the foot of this banyan tree. In the later years,the ruler of Cochin then decided to shift the lingam to a more convenient place and enclose it in the present temple.</p>
     <p> The temple has four gopurams each facing the four cardinal directions. The gopurams on the south and north are not open to the public. The public can enter through the east or west gopuram. Between the inner temple and the outer walls, there is a spacious compound. The inner temple is separated from the outer temple by a broad circular granite wall enclosing a broad praharam (corridor) called Chuttambalam. </p>
    <p>Lord Shiva's idol in the main sanctum is a large lingam. It is always concealed under a mound  of ghee,formed by the daily abhisheka with ghee over the years, and because of this the lingam is not easily visible. The ghee covered lingam is decorated with thirteen cascading crescents of gold and three serpent hoods on top.People believe that ghee has been presented to the Lord since many centuries and it has not gone bad or rancid and does not possess any bad smell. It is a wonder that even during the hot summer months , the ghee does not melt spite of the heat.</p>
