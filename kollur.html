    <p>Mookambika temple is an ancient temple dedicated to mother Sakthi located at Kollur in Karnataka, about 75 kms  away from Udupi.She is worshipped as Maha Kali in the morning, Maha Lakshmi in the noon and Saraswati in the evening. It is believed that Sri Adi Shankara himself installed the idol of deity in the temple some 1200 years ago. </p>
     <p>As per mythology there lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he got from Lord Brahma. When Kaumasura realised that his life is about to end soon , he undertook a severe penance. Before Lord Shiva could appear to grant im the boon, Goddess Saraswati,made him dumb so he could not speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura (or the mute demon). Goddess Lakshmi killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika,the slayer of Mookasura.</p><p>She is worshipped as Maha Kali in the morning, Maha Lakshmi in the noon and Saraswati in the evening.</p>

     <p>It is believed that Sri Adi Shankara himself installed the idol of deity in the temple some 1200 years ago.As per legends , Adi Shankara goddess lakshmi appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers and asker him his wishes. Sankara wanted her to come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her at that time. Goddess Lakshmi agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way  not looking back to check if she was with him. Should Sankara break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Sankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and the goddess’ anklets making sounds to know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the sounds of the anklets stopped and Sankara instincly looked backwards to see if she was still following him. As per the condition, the goddess stopped right there and wanted to stay in Kollur. Sankara apologized profusely for breaking the condition and pleaded with Lakshmi to go with him to Kerala. Pleased with Sankara's determination and devotion, Lakshmi  agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid day.</p>
