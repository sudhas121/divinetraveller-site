  <p> Legend has it that once Parvathi, the consort of Shiva, was doing penance under the temple's ancient Mango tree near Vegavathi river. In order to test her, Shiva sent Agni (fire) on her. Goddess Parvati prayed to her brother, Lord Vishnu for help. In order to save her, Lord Narayana (Vishnu) took the Moon from Shiva's head and showed the rays which then cooled down the fire and protected Parvathi. Shiva again sent the river Ganga to disrupt Parvathi's penance. Parvathi prayed to Ganga, and Ganga did not disturb her penance and Parvathi made a Shiva Linga out of sand to get united with Shiva. The God here came to be known as Ekambareswarar or "Lord of Mango Tree".</p>
        <p>
According to another legend, it is believed that Parvathi worshipped Shiva in the form of a Lingam made out of earth/sand ( Prithivi Lingam)  under a mango tree. Legend has it that the neighboring Vegavathi river overflowed and threatened to destroy the Lingam and that Parvathi or Kamakshi embraced the Lingam. Shiva pleased with her penance appeared before her and married her.

  <strong> The Temple: </strong>The temple covers an area of over 25 acres.Reaching to a height of 194 ft (59 metres), the temple's Raja gopuram (the main entrance tower) is one of the tallest in India. In the bottom portion or the entarnce, there are shrines for Ganesha and Lord Muruga on either sides. As you enter, you come across  Vahana Mandapam also called Sarabesa Mandapam. To the left of this is the "Kamba theertham" and a holy dip here, is said to be equivalant to have bathed in the Ganga, Jamuna and Saraswathy rivers.Next is the Aayiram Kaal Mandapam, ( "hall with thousand pillars"), which was built by the Vijayanagar Kings.  The sanctum sanctorum houses the lingam along with the image of Shiva. There are granite image of the 63 Nayanmars around the first praharam. The temple's inner most praharam has many Shivalingams, one of which is called a Sahasra Lingam with 1,008 Siva lingams sculpted on it. A notable feature here is that there is no separate shrine for Parvathi within the complex as with other Shiva temples in Kanchipuram. It is said that Kamakshi of Kamakshi Amman Temple which is nearby is the consort for Ekambaranathar. </p>
